# ğŸ–¥ Setup for danmaq's desktop mac.

I automated the setup procedure of my Mac with Ansible.  
If you look at this you'll be a reference for automating your Mac.

## Usage

### When you want setup your Mac

```SH
$ ./setup
```

### When you want to test operation on VM

```SH
$ ./test
```

## Dependency

* macOS: >= Sierra
* Vagrant: for only use `test`.

## ğŸ’¡ Advice

Even if you run this setup as it is, it will not be the environment you want.  
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
